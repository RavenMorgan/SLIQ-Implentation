# SLIQ-Implentation
The implementation of SLIQ involves several steps, including data preparation, partitioning the data into smaller subsets, mining frequent item sets in each partition,
storing the item sets in a trie tree data structure, merging and pruning the results to remove duplicates or infrequent item sets, and finally outputting the final results

There is a two files:
Python source files : -A simple implementation of SLIQ Algorithm in python that contains a classList where function of creating tree
                      and updating leafs based on other function that calculs gini index and main page tpo execute declared functions 
                      using data file.
data file: -contains differents data such as iris data and diabete data to build a trees
